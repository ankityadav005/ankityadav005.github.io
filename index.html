        <h1><strong><b>Introduction</b></strong></h1>
        <p><b>Air pollution is contamination of the indoor or outdoor environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. Air pollution is a mixture of solid particles and gases in the air.</b></p>

        <h1>Ozone</h1>
        <p>==>> Description: ozone is an molecule is a pale blue gas with a distinctively pungent smell.It formed from dioxygen by the action of ultraviolet light and electrical discharges within the earth's atmosphere.
           <br><br> Applications: Used for purify drinking water, kill bacteria,sanitize food, deodorize, and decrease aflatoxin contamination.</p>

            <p><b>Description:</b> Fossil fuel are the main causes of air pollution.
            <br><br>    <b>Applications:</b> Fossil fuels are used to produce energy; in the home they are burned to produce heat, in large power stations they are used to produce electricity and they are also used to power engines.</p>

                <h1><b>Fossil fuels</b></h1><br><br>
                <img src="https://sciencenotes.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Fossil-Fuel-Examples.png">
                <p><b>Description:</b> Fossil fuels are buried flammable geologic deposits of organic substance such as dead plants and animals that got deposited under several thousand feet of silt.
                 <br><br>   <b>Applications:</b> Heating, cooking, electricity, and also in our vehicles.</p>

                <p>When fossil fuels are burned, they release large amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas trap heat in our atmosphere, causing global warning.Already the average global temperature has increased by 1C.</p>

            <h1><b>Specifications Of air pollution</b></h1><br>
            <h1>Lead:</h1>
            <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/18/22318-050-B9CD67E5/element-symbol-Pb-square-periodic-table-some.jpg">
            <br><br>
            <p><b>Definition:</b> Sources that contribute to lead in the ambient air include smelters, mining operations, waste incinerators, battery recycling, and the production of lead shot and fishing sinkers.
               <br><br> <b>Units:</b> Typically expressed in micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood(dl),that is , mg/dL. 
                <br><br><b>Importance:</b> It is still widely used for car batteries, pigments,ammunition,cable sheathing, weights for lifting, weight belts for diving , lead crystal glass , radiation protection and in some solders.
                </p>
                <p><strong>What is geothermal energy?</strong><br>Geothermal energy is heat within the earth. The word geothermal comes from the Greek words geo (earth) and therme (heat). Geothermal energy is a renewable energy source because heat is continuously produced inside the earth. People use geothermal heat for bathing, for heating buildings, and for generating electricity.</p>         

               <br> <h1>electrostatics:</h1><br><br>

               <br><br>
               <p<b>>Definition:</b> Electrostatics is a branch of physics that deals with the phenomena and properties of stationary or slow-moving electric charges.
               <br><br><b> Units:</b> SI unit of electrostatics of volt.
               <br><br> <b>Importance:</b> when particle material is electrically insulating so the electric charge can be retained. </p><br>
               <p>The size of a solar panel is measured in watts, which indicates the amount of power it can generate. The most common solar panel sizes for residential installations are between 250W and 400W, while larger commercial installations may use panels up to 500W or more.</p>
